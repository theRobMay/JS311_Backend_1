NOTES:

I need a todo backend and the following is what I want to support

-A route that will return all items
GET: /todos
return an array of todo objects

-A route that will return a single item based on the ID provided
GET: /todos/:id
:id is the id of the todo item to return if it exists
otherwise null

-A route that will delete a single item based on the ID provided
DELETE /todos/:id
:id is the id of the todo item to delete
return the item that was deleted

-A route that will add a new todo item
POST /todos
body should include object that has a description
ex: {"description": "water garden"}

-A route that will update an existing item based on the ID provided
PUT /todos/:id
body should include object that has a description and a completed flag
ex: /todos/5, body={"description": "mow the yard", "completed": true}

Todo Object:
{
    "id": the id of the todo,
    "description": what the todo is,
    "completed": true/false based on status,
}
{
    "id": 34234,
    "description": "get funky",
    "completed": true,
}
